## About Active Directory, [BloodHound](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows-hardening/active-directory-methodology/bloodhound)
BloodHound is a tool used to analyze Active Directory environments to identify and visualize potential attack paths and security weaknesses, providing attackers with a clear map of exploitable relationships and privileges within a network.<br>

## From an Attacker's perspective, BloodHound is advantageous 
because it allows them to efficiently map out an organization's Active Directory structure, identify weak points, and pinpoint high value targets such as users with elevated privileges, thus enabling strategic planning of attacks to escalate privileges and move laterally within the network.<br>
