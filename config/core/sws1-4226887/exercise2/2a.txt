Answer:

To fix the problem with newlines interrupting the matching process, the tr command is used (translate or delete characters).
Tr is reading in the content of genome.txt and is deleting newlines ('\n') in memory. It is therefore no in-place functionality. 
After removing all newlines, we essentially are left with one long line which we can pipe towards grep. 
Grep is used for the matching process with the -o flag (--only-matching) which gives us the occurences of a word every 
time although it might occur several times in the same line. Without the -o flag, grep only prints out matching lines. 
So, everytime grep finds the pattern, it prints out the pattern in a new line. All we have to to now is counting the occurences 
which can be done by the wc command (word count) with either the -w flag (words) or -l (lines) flag. In this scenario it does not 
really matter. The total occurence of the word GATTACA is therefore 4.
