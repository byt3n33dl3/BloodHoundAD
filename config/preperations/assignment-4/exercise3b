The main problem is due to the two free commands at the very end.
Because m and mt are multidimensional arrays (arrays of arrays),
the free command only frees the allocated memory of the first dimension
but not the contained arrays on the second dimensions. This leads 
to a memory leak and after enough iterations this program would 
probably end with a return result of -1 because malloc is not able 
to allocate any more memory based on the memory leak.

A simple solution would be to iterate through the first dimension of
the array and then free any contained array on the second dimension
separately. At the very end, the outer array itself can be freed.
The fix is contained in a separate function in exercise3.c.
