* Answer: 

According to the two before mentioned links, /dev/random and /dev/urandom are using the same Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG). The only difference between these two is that /dev/random blocks when it runs out of entropy (halts processes execution) and /dev/urandom will never block. Most of the time you should use /dev/urandom. There is only one rare case where /dev/random should be used when shortly after boot on a low entropy device and the entropy pool has not been seeded properly yet.
